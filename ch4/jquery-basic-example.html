/*
jQuery is a javascript library. It features:
- DOM CSS style element selection/manipulation
- Events
- Effects and animations
- Ajax
- Asynchronous
- JSON parsing
- Utilities
- Cross-browser compatibility (if something doesn't work on that browser, it tries the next best thing, and so onâ€¦)

If you wanna load it locally, use npm install jquery. 

Otherwise, you use a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which is a website that basically holds the scripts for you, such as Google Hosted Libraries or code.jquery.com. Just copy the provided script tag and paste it on your HTML file.

Advantages of local: you can work without a connection and you can look through the source code.
Advantages of CDN: less server bandwidth use and is faster (because of cache somehow)
